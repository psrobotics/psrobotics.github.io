  <p><strong>Project status</strong> Ongoing</p>
  <p>A wearable haptic exoskeleton helps user to ineract with virtual environment in a natural way. The first generation hardware comes with thumb and index moudle. Each finger moudle have 3 indepent actuar for a all direction force feedback at user's fingertip. Also, a 3dof rss moudle can provide limited haptic feedback for user's fingertip. </p>
   <p>The project uses brushless motors with tendon based reducer to construct a high power-desenty actuar with good back-drive ability. The motor driver with current feedback is still in design process. After that, the joint output turque can be controlled via current feedback. </p>
